# Splunk Synthetics Terraform Provider

**Until this description is changed this is not a complete provider. Currently it may not even work. Proceed at your own risk.**

This repository is an **alpha* Terraform provider for [Splunk Synthetics (formerly Rigorâ„¢)](https://monitoring.rigor.com/). It currently contains CRUD operations for HTTP (Uptime) Checks and Real Browser Checks with some caveats:

 - Currently Real Browser Checks cannot have `steps` or `javascript_files` added via Public API and thus are not included in this provider.
 - Integrations are not managed by this provider and must be setup in the UI and referenced with their ID number.
 - Private Locations are not managed by this provider and must be setup in the UI and referenced with their ID number.
 - Excluding custom files is currently not supported. All preset file exclusions are included and working.
 
This repo and the companion [Synthetics Golang client](https://github.com/splunk/syntheticsclient) are not DRY and are specifically verbose for code auditing and teaching reasons.     

**NOTE:** The client expects a valid Synthetics API token defined as an environment variable named `API_ACCESS_TOKEN` (E.G. `export API_ACCESS_TOKEN="This_is_my_api_token"`)
